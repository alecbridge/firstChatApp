# firstChatApp

The Goal of this assignment is to make a basic chat style application using React and Routers for multiple pages. Should result in an app that can take a username from 'login' and an input (note) submitted on the App to form a cooperative note system.

The chat box should at least include a way to submit text into a chat room and a checkbox of any sort. (Checkbox currently has no purpose)

The idea I decided to go with is what I am calling "Note-oriety" which is a type of site where you can create a chat room initially for yourself to submit notes or ideas.  From there you can share the room with others, which will be able to join and see your existing notes and be able to add to them as well. It can be as private or as public as you'd like.
