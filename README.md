# firstChatApp

The Goal of this assignment is to make a basic chat style application using React and Routers for multiple pages.

The chat box should at least include a way to submit text into a chat room and a checkbox of any sort.

The idea I decided to go with is a "Note to self" (renamed to Note-oreity) type chat where you can create a chat room initially for yourself to submit notes with a due date/time.  Or you can either join or supply the room code/url to someone so that they can add to the
list as well.

Dependencies used include:
`hjs-webpack, react, react-dom, react-router`
